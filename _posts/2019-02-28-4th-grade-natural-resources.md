<p style="text-align:left">This post will present some important information for 4th grade's unit 7: Environmental Education. Topic: Natural resources. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natural resources are everything that is provided for us by nature. They are not created by humans. They can can be classified in two categories: renewable or non-renewable. A natural resource is renewable if it grows again or comes back after we use it. A non-renewable resource does not grow or come back, or it takes a very long time before it is replenished. Here you have a list of the most important natural resources in the world:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>1. Water</strong><br>Planet earth is mostly formed by water, but only about 2 percent of it is fresh water. And from that fresh water, even less is considered to be potable. Potable water is water that is considered to be safe to drink and cook with. Many countries are working to build water treatment plants, so we can obtain more potable water. But due to changes in the climate the amount of rain and ice melts from winter have dropped off and lowered the reserve supplies of freshwater to be treated. There are initiatives to educate and regulate the use of water in the world. Water is a very important natural resource for all humans, please take care of it!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Air</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clean air is necessary for the existence of life on this planet. It is essential for the existence of plants, animals and wildlife. It is important to reduce air pollution as polluted air degrades the environment and can enter our body and can cause health related problems. You can help to protect the air by taking the bus or using public transport instead of a regular car, riding your bicycle or walking, planting a garden or planting trees.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Coal</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coal is a natural resource estimated to be able to last less than 200 more years. As big countries like China increase their use of coal, it will run out faster. Coal is also the major source of air pollution in the world so there is much discussion about regulating its usage. But, the problem is it is one of the cheapest sources of fuel for industrial applications.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Oil</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oil is one of the most valuable natural resources in the world, and one of the most essential to our modern way of life. Our transportation and manufacturing industries are completely reliant on petroleum products. As a result, the entire face of the planet is changing as countries race to secure their oil resources.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Natural Gas</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gas is a much cleaner fuel source than oil, which has led to an increased level of consumption of it as an alternative fuel. It is used in houses for space heating and water heating. It is also used in stoves, ovens, clothes dryers, lighting fixtures and other appliances.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6. Sunlight</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a valuable natural resource, a little bit of sun exposure has several health benefits for your body. Plants need it for the photosynthesis. It is also a good source of energy. But we shouldn’t take this resource for granted. We may not be able to affect the sun, but if we continue to pollute the environment, someday, the rays of the sun may not reach us anymore. That’s why we should stop pollution.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. Iron</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Iron has been possibly the most important elemental natural resource on earth until the modern age's dependence on petroleum products. Iron allowed our ancestors to forge stronger weapons, build better transportation, erect taller buildings and ultimately allowed the modern world to take shape. Iron and steel are still incredibly important today in modern industries.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8. Soil.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soil is composed of many different particles and nutrients which  helps plants grow. Apart from this, soil can also be used as the foundation for many construction projects</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9. Forests</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the world gets more modern and population grows, there is more of a demand for housing and construction projects. This reduces open green spaces. Forests are necessary to preserve the ecology of the world that supports all of the natural resources and life.</p>

<p><strong>10. Other Biological Natural Resources</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They include plants, animals, fish and even microbes. Plants supply food, animals and fish provide food, work and companionship. Some microbes, microscopic creatures and bacteria are used to naturally ferment foods and drinks when making yogurt, cheese or root beer.</p>
