<p>In this post will present information of 5th grade’s unit 6: Costa Rican Beauties. Topic: The seven provinces of Costa Rica. Have fun learning.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Costa Rica has 7 provinces: San José. Alajuela, Heredia, Cartago, Guanacaste, Limon and Puntarenas.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>San José</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is the capital and main hub for everything related to economy and politics, and it features most of the major annual festivals. Strolling through ‘Avenida Central’ or visiting ‘Teatro National’ and the nearby ‘Museo National’ are a must if you choose to visit San Jose while on your vacation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Alajuela</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Province is the setting for two incredible National Parks: the Arenal Volcano National Park in the north attracts tourists with its breathtaking views, hot springs and an amazing list of adventure tours on offer in the area; and the Poas Volcano National Park, known for the volcano’s gigantic crater, which is ranked as one of the biggest in the world.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Cartago </em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was the first colonial city established in Costa Rica and its first capital. There are two historical treasures of this city: the ancient ruins of Cartago—the ruins of a catholic cathedral that remained unfinished due to an earthquake in 1910; and also the “Basilica de Cartago”—the emblem of Costa Rica’s Catholic Church. You will find two of the most active volcanoes in this province: the highest active and usually cloudy Irazu Volcano, and the Turrialba Volcano which towers over the Turrialba town.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Heredia</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Province is well-known for its capital city of the same name, known as the ‘the city of flowers’. A few historical monuments give the city its own distinct character; one such notable is “El Fortín”, a circular tower constructed in 1876 that became the symbol of the city. Others include the Braulio Carrillo National Park and INBio Parque, the National Institute of Biodiversity that does scientific studies about wildlife in Costa Rica.</p>

<p><strong><em>Guanacaste </em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Province features the beautiful, white-sand beaches of Costa Rica’s northwest Pacific coast. From Conchal and Papagayo up in the north to the Nicoya Peninsula, the wonders of this province make it a “must visit” for beach lovers. In Guanacaste there are also dazzling National Parks like Rincon de la Vieja National Park and Las Baulas Marine National Park.</p>

<p><strong><em>Limón </em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Is the province with Caribbean flavor and African spice. The remote and beautiful Tortuguero National Park, the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge in the north and La Amistad National Park in the south are some of the places where you can truly enjoy Costa Rica’s stunning nature. Limon’s Caribbean roots are the appeal for many travelers seeking for a relaxed and easy going atmosphere.</p>
