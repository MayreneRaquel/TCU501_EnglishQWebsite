<p>Pollution is a really serious problem that is affecting our planet. It is defined as anything that makes the earth dirty or unhealthy. Land air and water are all affected by pollution. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several types of pollution:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Air pollution: </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a large amount of poisonous gases are released into the atmosphere, we are talking about air pollution. Several things can cause this, like burning of fossil fuels by automobiles, industrial release of gases and the release of methane gasses from animal and landfill wastes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the gases that increase the earth’s temperature and are responsible for global warming are called greenhouse gases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Air pollution can cause a lot of negative health issues for people. For example: it can lead to asthma, worsen existing respiratory problems, and some people develop chronic illnesses such as lung cancer, pulmonary diseases, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Land or soil pollution:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the result of billions of people dumping waste on the land. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>These wastes consist of harmful chemicals that leak underground and pollute the soil and the deeper layers of the Earth.</li><li>We should follow the 3 Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. If we reduce our waste and try to reuse them by recycling them, it will cause less harm to our environment.</li><li>We need to dispose of trash responsibly to prevent land pollution. Carry the waste to recycling centers, where it is recycled to make new products. This is the most effective way of reducing waste.</li></ul>

<p>Water pollution is the pollution of water bodies at the source: like rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, and groundwater.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
